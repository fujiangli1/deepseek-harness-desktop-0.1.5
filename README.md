DeepSeek Harness Desktop packages the official DeepSeek Harness Web experience as a standalone desktop application. It removes the need to start the CLI manually or manage local ports while preserving the full Harness interface.

This project focuses on desktop hosting. It does not fork, modify, inject into, or reimplement the Harness UI. Models, sessions, settings, plugins, and agent capabilities remain provided by the official `@deepseek-ai/dsh` package.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an unofficial community wrapper and an early-stage project. It depends on the rapidly evolving `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.1-rc.2`. The macOS builds are not Apple-notarized, and the Windows builds are not commercially code-signed.

All current and historical packages are available on the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/agent-earth/deepseek-harness-desktop/releases), and you can also download from the Quark Drive mirror: [Quark Drive - DeepSeek Harness Desktop v0.3.1](https://pan.quark.cn/s/e2dfc232c52d)

## Why this project exists

DeepSeek Harness already provides the complete agent runtime and Web UI. This project supplies the host capabilities required for a desktop product:

- Start and stop the local Harness service automatically
- Allocate a random `127.0.0.1` loopback port
- Wait for Harness readiness before displaying the window
- Provide a single-instance desktop window and safe external navigation
- Enable sandboxing, `contextIsolation`, and navigation restrictions
- Package installable releases for macOS, Windows, and Linux

## Features

- Opens the official Harness interface as soon as the local service is ready
- Shows a lightweight loading screen while the local Harness service starts
- Includes **Settings → Plugin Market**, powered by [dsh-market](https://github.com/dsh-market/dsh-market) and the curated [awesome-dsh-plugin](https://github.com/awesome-dsh-plugin/awesome-dsh-plugin) catalog
- Bundles pnpm so catalog plugins can be installed, updated, and removed without a separate Node.js toolchain
- Keeps running in the system tray when the main window is closed
- Opens the active local Harness URL in the system browser from the tray menu
- Preserves the complete settings, models, sessions, plugins, and agent experience
- Gracefully terminates the Harness child process on application exit
- Listens only on a random local loopback port
- Supports macOS on Apple Silicon and Intel
- Blends the macOS title bar with the active DSH light or dark theme
- Provides a Windows x64 installer and portable ZIP
- Provides Linux x64 AppImage and deb packages
- Uses the official in-app directory browser on Windows to avoid packaged native-dialog worker failures
- Reserves a draggable Windows title bar so native window controls do not cover Harness content
- Removes the default Electron File, Edit, View, and Window menu bar on Windows

## Plugin market

Open **Settings → Plugin Market** to browse and search the community catalog, inspect plugin sources, and install, update, disable, or remove plugins. The catalog is fetched live from [awesome-dsh-plugin.com](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com), while package changes use the official `dsh plugin --profile web` workflow and remain in your local DSH profile.

The desktop package includes `dshmarket@1.40.0` and a compatible pnpm runtime. Market-triggered process restart is disabled because application lifecycle remains owned by the desktop host; refresh the page or restart DeepSeek Harness Desktop when a plugin indicates that a restart is required.

> [!WARNING]
> Catalog entries are community-maintained third-party code, not endorsements by DeepSeek or this project. Installed plugins run locally with your user permissions and may access data available to Harness. Review the source, publisher, permissions, and build-script warning before installing.

## Installation

### macOS

The macOS builds are integrity-signed but are not Apple-notarized. On first launch:

1. Open the DMG and drag **DeepSeek Harness** into **Applications**.
2. Try to open the app; if macOS blocks it, click **Done**.
3. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.
4. Find DeepSeek Harness in the **Security** section and click **Open Anyway**.
5. Confirm by clicking **Open** once more.

This confirmation is normally required only once.

### Windows

The Windows installer is not commercially code-signed. If Microsoft Defender SmartScreen appears:

1. Click **More info**.
2. Click **Run anyway**.
3. Complete the setup wizard.

### Linux

- AppImage: run `chmod +x DeepSeek-Harness-Desktop-*.AppImage`, then launch it directly.
- Debian / Ubuntu: open the deb with the system software installer, or run `sudo apt install ./DeepSeek-Harness-Desktop-*.deb`.

## Security model

- Harness binds only to `127.0.0.1` on a random port
- Node.js integration is disabled in the renderer
- `contextIsolation` and the Chromium sandbox are enabled
- New windows and cross-origin navigation open in the system browser
- Harness runs in a separate Electron Node child process
- The `--expose-internals` permission required by Cordis HMR is granted only to the Harness child process
- Plugin Market mutation endpoints require same-origin requests, and install sources are restricted to the curated catalog
- Third-party plugins still execute with the current user's permissions after installation

## Validation status

| Platform | Packaging | Packaged startup | Web UI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| macOS Apple Silicon | DMG / ZIP passed | Passed | HTTP 200 |

Every release package is built on a matching GitHub-hosted runner and runs a packaged-app smoke test before publication.

## Known limitations

- Upstream DSH is still an RC release and may change rapidly
- Apple Developer ID signing and notarization are not integrated
- Commercial Windows code signing is not integrated, so SmartScreen may appear
- Windows ARM64 and Linux ARM64 packages are not currently provided
- Automatic updates are not integrated

## Upstream version and license

The project currently pins `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.1-rc.2` for reproducible packaging.

The desktop wrapper is available under the [MIT License](LICENSE). The bundled DeepSeek Harness, dsh-market, and pnpm packages are also MIT-licensed; their notices are preserved under [`third-party-licenses`](third-party-licenses).

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by DeepSeek. DeepSeek Harness and related names belong to their respective owners. The application icon uses the black whale artwork from the upstream DeepSeek Harness Web favicon.
